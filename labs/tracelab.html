<h1>Lab 7 - Tracing Code</h1>
<p>
For the first, and maybe only time, you don't have to submit a questions file.
This week, the tables have turned, instead of me looking at your code, you will look at mine.
You will edit my code and make comments on it.
The code is on BBLearn under <code>l7.t</code>.
This is a plain text document, I expect you to edit it with a plain text editor.
Since you will be making changes to the code, I expect you to compile and run it, which means use tux and nano.
</p>
<p>
Comment your name, abc123 user id, and lab section at the top of the file.

<h2>Part 1 - Tracing and Commenting (80 pts)</h2>
<p>
I have given you some code.
If you run the code <a href="labs/l7.html">here</a> you will see it asks for an
input, then nothing appears to happen after that. I will tell you that the
input you give, is the velocity to throw a ball directly up into the air. What the
code actually does is for you to figure out. Read through the code, and figure out
what it's doing.
</p>
<p>
As you read through this code, comment it.
What is each function doing?
What is each line doing?
How does this line help us reach the end goal?
What does function mean?
What does each line mean?
I have intentionally used single letter variable names.
What is each variable used for?
These are some questions I want you to keep in mind.
</p>
<p>
When commenting your code, I want you to actually think and dig deep. Let's consider
the following fragment of code. This code is a simple counting program that counts
from 1 to 5.
</p>
<pre>
var c
c : 1
loop {
	until .c > 5
	iprint(.c)
	nl()
	c : .c + 1
}
</pre>
<p>
Now one way to comment this would be the following.
</p>
<pre>
var c # initializes variable c
c : 1 # sets c to 1
loop {
	until .c > 5 # loops until the contents of c are greater than 5
	iprint(.c) # prints the contents of c
	nl() # prints a nl
	c : .c + 1 # adds 1 to the contents of c and updates the value
}
</pre>
<p>
Let me tell you why I hate the above. While it does accurately explain what the
code is doing, it has no relation to what the code means. Here's a better example.
</p>
<pre>
var c # initializes variable c. c represents the current count
c : 1 # sets c to 1, the count starts at 1

# loops until we reach the end of our count, which is when the contents of c are
# greater than 5
loop {
	until .c > 5
	iprint(.c) # prints the current count
	nl() # prints a nl for clarity
	c : .c + 1 # increases the count by adding 1
}
</pre>
<p>
Now as you can see, the comments are a LOT more descriptive, and a lot more helpful.
You don't need to comment every single line of code, but definitely consider the
questions in the paragraph above, and comment what you think is necessary.
</p>
<p>
I will
be grading you based on how helpful and accurate your comments are. That being said,
there is no "correct answer". I don't have a rubric of comments I expect you to have.
If you have the exact same character for character comments as someone else, you'll
both get 0s for plagiarism. You won't need to work with a partner for this lab because
this lab is about reading and comprehending code, which is done individually.
Commenting code is aimed at helping YOU understand what's going on.
</p>

<h2>Part 2 - Editing (20 pts)</h2>
<p>
Now that you understand what the code is doing and have sufficiently commented what
happens at each step, its time to edit the code I wrote. When you run the code, it
produces no output, I want you to produce an output. For this step, somewhere in the
code, you will add statements to print out a table of time and height values. DO NOT
change any calculations or move any code. You are ONLY to add printing statements. Given
input 20, I expect an output of the following numbers, in a similar, equally as
readable format. I am grading you based on the accuracy and readability of the information
displayed. I intentionally used single letter headers to not give away info
as to what the code does.
</p>
<pre>
T : Y
0 : 0
1 : 15
2 : 20
3 : 15
4 : 0
</pre>
<p>
You may want to ask me any of the following questions: "Do we have to use colons?",
"Do we have to label our table with T and Y?", "Can we change the spacing?".
To which I answer, it doesn't matter. I care about the information that is conveyed
and that the information is readable and comprehensible. If you ask me any questions
regarding if the format of your table is okay, the I will tell you to "Read The Lab"
because you clearly did not read this paragraph, and probably did not read many
other paragraphs. A good test is if you can give your code to a friend who is not
taking this class, have them run it. If an unrelated party can understand your table,
then you did a good job.
</p>

<h2>Part 3 - Improving (Extra Credit 5 pts)</h2>
<p>
This part is extra credit, but if you see parts of my code that could cause errors,
are not as optimized as they could be, or you think could be better. In a comment
underneath your name and section header, suggest what you would do differently and what
you would improve and why. DO NOT actually change my code with your suggestion.
