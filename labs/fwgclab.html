	<h1>Puzzle of the Farmer, the Wolf, the Goat, and the Cabbage</h1>
	<p>
		As usual, answer all questions in a <i>plain text file</i>
		named <code>questions4.txt</code>.
		At the top of your plain text file, please include your name, user id, and lab section.
		Failure to do so will result in a 0.

		This classic problem requires that the farmer carry his wolf, goat, and
		cabbage across a river in a leaky boat. 
		Because the boat leaks, the farmer can only take one of the three items
		in each trip across the river.  
		However, if the wolf is left alone with the goat, it eats the goat.  
		Similarly, if the goat is left alone with the cabbage, it eats the cabbage.
		<br><br>
		In this lab, you will create a digital logic circuit that will allow a 
		user to attempt to solve this puzzle.  
		You'll also publish this puzzle on your web page.
		<br><br>
		During lecture, we said we would be doing a number related lab this week.
		However, we had a slight change of heart and will be doing this one instead.

	<h3>Question 1 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>	
		Start by opening the 
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/cs164/logwb/logwb.html">logic workbench</a> 
		and wiring up the inputs as illustrated here.
	</p>

	<p>
		The four toggle switches each represent the four things to move across the river:
		the farmer, the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage.  
		When the corresponding switch is turned off, 
		it represents the item being on the left side of the river.  
		When it's turned on, it represents the item on the right side of the river.  
		If your browser supports it, 
		I recommend double clicking on the names of the switches and changing them to 
		names that describe the items they represent.  
		The push on switch is used to test a configuration to see whether it is 
		a final solution, a safe state, or a dangerous state.

		Your first task for this lab is to create a circuit for detecting the 
		successful completion of the task. 
		You should design and construct a circuit that illuminates an LED when 
		all four are on the right side of the river. 
		Test your circuit and ensure that the LED lights exactly when all four
		toggle switches are on and the push button is pressed.  
		Take a PDF capture of your circuit, name it circuit3.pdf and upload it with
		questions3.txt .
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 2 (15pts)</h3>
	<p>
		For using logic to express the behavior of this puzzle, 
		we will have four Boolean variables: <i>f</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>g</i>, and <i>c</i>.
		These correspond to the farmer, the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage, respectively.
		For each of the variables, a True value indicates that the corresponding thing 
		is on the right bank of the river, and a False value indicates that it is 
		on the left bank.
		<br><br>
		The next step in developing this puzzle web page is to write a Boolean 
		expression that is True when there is a potential problem on the right bank: 
		that is when the farmer is not there and either the wolf and goat or the goat 
		and cabbage are there.  
		Remember, it's only a problem if the farmer is not there to keep control.  
		Write down the truth table for the answer.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 3 (15pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Now that you have a truth table, you can build an equation off of this.
		From your equation, build it in the logic workbench and make sure you test
		all the cases. 
		Write your boolean expression as an answer.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 4 (15pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Now we need to address the same issue on the other side of the river.  
		In particular, we want to create a circuit that lights an LED when there 
		is danger on the left side of the river.  
		As before, you're asked to write down the truth table for the danger condition 
		in this problem, and you'll be asked to create the circuit in the next.  
		So below, write the truth table for the danger on the other side of the river.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 5 (15pts)</h3>
	<p>
		As before, write a boolean expression for the truth table you wrote in question 4.
		From there, wire it up and test it in the logic workbench.
		For the answer write your expression.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 6 (15pts)</h3>
	<p>
		At this point, you should have a complete circuit that simulates the actions 
		that take place in this puzzle.  
		Each member of your lab group should now use another person's circuit to 
		attempt to solve the puzzle.  
		Did you find any problems with anyone else's circuit?  
		If so, what were they? 
		Did anyone find any problems with your circuit?  
		If so, what were they and how did you fix them?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 7 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		We're gonna do a quick break from the boolean algebra to prepare you for the next step.
		You're going to complete 
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/cs164/htmltut/html.html">this tutorial</a>
		on HTML.
		In the next step, you're going to create a webpage to display the circuit you've made.
		To recieve credit for question 7, what is the answer to part 8 of the tutorial?
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 8 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Now that you've finished development of your puzzle and thoroughly tested it,
		it's time to publish the result.  
		Create a web page named <b>fwgc.html</b> in your public_html directory on tux.  
		To get the data to paste into that file, 
		go back to your circuit in the logic workbench.  
		On a Mac, use command-left click to change the graphical display 
		to the circuit data.  
		Other other platforms, use ctrl-left click to do the same thing.  
		When you have your circuit description in textual form, 
		cut and paste it into the HTML file.  
		You can then use command-left click or ctrl-left click to return to the 
		graphical presentation of the circuit.
		<br><br>
		The next step is to enhance the HTML file so that it's more than just the logic workspace.
		In particular, you should use the h1 tag to create a title for your page.
		Then you should include some text (with proper HTML markup) 
		that describes what the puzzle is and gives instructions for the user to attempt to 
		solve the puzzle.  
		Use the other HTML files you've worked with in lab as examples to follow 
		for the HTML markup.
		<br><br>
		To view your results, you'll also need to download some JavaScript and CSS files
		into the same directory where you are editing your HTML file.  
		The files you'll need are:
		<ul>
			<li>jquery-2.1.1.min.js</li>
			<li>simcir-basicset.css</li>
			<li>simcir-basicset.js</li>
			<li>simcir-library.js</li>
			<li>simcir.css</li>
			<li>simcir.js</li>
		</ul>
		On tux, copy all the files from the directory <code>~bls96/public_html/cs164/logwb</code> to your 
		public_html directory to get these files.
		There are also sample files in that directory that you can look at to embed your circuit.
		<br><br>
		For a little more help in setting up your html document, go to
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/cs164/logwb/sample.html">this webpage.</a>
		It has a bit more on how to set up the HTML and embed your circuit.
		<br><br>
		Finally, edit your public_html/index.html file to have a link to 
		the new file with your circuit.  
		For an answer, give the URLs for both your fwgc.html page and your home page.
	</p>

	<h3>Extra Credit (5pts)</h3>
<!--
	<p>
		If you are in the honors section, this is not extra credit.
		Failure to answer this question will result in a loss of 5 points.
		If you do not have an H in your lab section nuber on BBLearn, this is extra credit.
	</p>
-->
	<p>
		If you finish the main assignment and want to do a little more for a few points of 
		extra credit, then clean up the way the circuit workspace looks.  
		In particular, figure out how to remove the toolbar of circuit elements that 
		appears on the left side of the workspace.  
		Also change the size of the workspace so that it shows the full circuit with 
		just a small amount of blank space around it. 
		Describe below what you did to figure out the changes that needed to be made.
