	<h1>Drexel Computing Environment</h1>
	<p>
		Are you ready kids?
		<i>(Aye aye captain!)</i>
		<br>
		<br>
		You are going to answer these questions in a plaintext file called <b>questions1.txt</b>.
		DO NOT use Microsoft Word.
		DO NOT use TextEdit.
		If you submit a docx or pdf or rtf file or ANYTHING that isn't a <u>PLAIN TEXT FILE</u> you will recieve a 0 for the lab.
		Write all your answers in a <i>plain text file</i>.
		You can use Notepad or SublimeText or a GUI text editor.
		We would prefer you use a command line editor like nano or vim or emacs, but we don't talk about those til later in the lab,
		so it is acceptable to not use that option until you learn it.
		Just please, put your answers in a <b><u><i>plain text file.</i></u></b>
		<br><br>
		If you choose to work with a partner on this lab, you may work with only one other person.
		Put your partners name in your header too. You both must submit separate lab sheets in your BBLearn shell.
		<br><br>
		You will submit questions1.txt on BBLearn under the Lab1 assignment.
		At the top of your plain text file, make sure to include your name, user id, and lab section.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h3>Question 1 - Make Friends (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		If you haven't already, join the lab BBLearn Collaborate room at the appropriate time.
		The link to the lab rooms are on the BB Collaborate tab on the left side of the CS164 BBLearn page.
		Normally, you would partner up with the person sitting next to you, sadly we don't have that option anymore.
		Upon entering the online room, we can set you up in breakout rooms to work on the lab together.
		If you don't want to do this, you can work on the lab alone.
		If you work on the lab with a partner,
		each of you will use Blackboard for submitting answers to the questions on your own Blackboard account.
		For each question, you should each finish answering the question before moving ahead to the next question.
		If you or your lab partner(s) have problems completing a step,
		try working together on it.
		Notify your lab assistant if problems persist.
		<br><br>
		Introduce yourself to your lab partners. 
		Each of you should write down your name and userid.
		For this question, write down who you worked on this lab with, and their user ids.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 2 - Meet your TAs (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Your TAs should have identified themselves by writing their names and emails in the chat. 
		If they have not done this, hound them endlessly until they do. 
		Record your TAs names and email addresses for question 2, 
		and also somewhere for your future reference throughout the term. 
		(Note: some reassignment of teaching assistants may occur before next week.)
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 3 - Your Drexel Account (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		You should already have been issued a userid and password and an email address.
		We will refer to it as your userid here, 
		but you may hear is called your Drexel One ID or login or your single signon ID or login.  
		It is what you used to log into this Blackboard session to do this lab.  
		It also permits you access to file space on the tux server (also referred to as the cs.drexel.edu server). 
		<br><br>
		You should recognize that the Blackboard server is a different machine than the cs.drexel.edu server, 
		and you have accounts on both machines. 
		(See picture below.) 
		The Blackboard server is used for managing this course (CS 164): 
		your lab interactions are stored on this machine; 
		your homework assignments and labs are submitted for grading by your instructors and teaching assistants; 
		and your grades for this course will be stored on this machine. 
		The personal nature of these activities explains the need for your userid and password on this server.
		<br><br>
		The Blackboard server does not permit your files to be accessed via the World Wide Web.
		For this, you need to use the cs.drexel.edu server.
	</p>

	<center>
		<img src="labs/WebCT.png">	
	</center>
	<p>
		Your userid on tux permits you to create and maintain your own web site. 
		While creation of a home page, etc. is beyond the extent of today's lab, 
		you will create the site and post a public file on it. 
		In this section you will perform some steps that should only need to be
		done once for the lifetime of your account, to set it up properly. 
		In later sections, you will create a file and post it at your site.
		<br><br>
		In order to create a Tux account, you should have recieved an email from Brian Bijeau.
		It is an encrypted email.
		Here you will be given a temporary password.
		If you did not get that email, email Brian Bijeau at bjb344@drexel.edu
	</p>
	<p>
		Describe any problems or struggles you had getting into Tux.
		If there were no problems, write "No Problems".
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 4 - Log Into Tux (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Step 1: Cloak and Dagger.</b>
		Now that you have created your tux account, 
		it's time to log into it and issue some commands.  
		The protocol we will be using to communicate between your computer and tux is called the Secure Shell (SSH).  
		This system supports multiple methods of authenticating your identity
		with the server and provides a mechanism for encrypting all of the communication
		between machines.  
		There exist SSH implementations for nearly any platform you would like to use, 
		including Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, Windows, Android, iOS, Plan9, etc.
		<br><br>
		If you are running any of the UNIX variants (e.g. Linux, BSD, or Mac OS X), 
		you already have an implementation of SSH installed.  
		For most distributions of these systems, the implementation included is called OpenSSH. 
		This package has also been ported to Windows by the Microsoft PowerShell developers. 
		If you are running Windows, you should already have OpenSSH installed.
		If you do not have OpenSSH, you can download and install OpenSSH from:
		<br><br>
		<a href="http://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases">http://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases</a>
		<br><br>
		or you can install OpenSSH as part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  
		If you wish to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux, 
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/cs164/winlin.html">this page</a> will walk you through the process.  
		<br><br>
		For all environments, open a terminal (command) window and issue the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>ssh </code><i>userid</i><code>@tux.cs.drexel.edu</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		putting your userid before the @ sign.  
		On Windows, if you are running the power shell instead of the classic command prompt,
		you'll need to prefix the ssh command with ./ (i.e. <code>./ssh</code> ...). 
		The result of this should look like:
	</p>
	<center>
		<img src="labs/tux_login.png">
	</center>

	<p>
		Note that the dialog regarding the server's fingerprint will only appear 
		the first time to connect to that host.  
		All subsequent times you log in, you'll go directly to the password prompt.  
		Also note that the details of the login in message printed before 
		the command prompt will differ for each person.
		<br><br>
		If any member of your team is unable to get to this point, stop and get help from a TA.
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 2: Server Farms.</b>  
		Tux is actually a set of systems and you won't always connect to the same one every time.  
		The last line printed on the screen is shown above as bls96@tux2:~$.  
		This the prompt for you to type a command to the shell you selected earlier.  
		The tux2 part of the prompt indicates that I'm logged into the second member of the collection.  
		Which tux instance did you log in to?
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 3: Running Nonstop.</b>  
		At the prompt use the command uptime to find out how long it's been since this tux was last rebooted.  
		How long has this tux been up?  
		Record your answer.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 5 - Scavenger Hunt (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
 		At this point, you are logged into tux and ready to create a web site.  
		Before we go through the steps to create it, 
		there are several commands that will be useful to you in the process.  
		We begin with a brief summary of them:
		<br><br>
		<b>cat :</b> Concatenate files and print them to the standard output.
		<br>
		<b>cd :</b> Change current directory.  This is used to move to a different directory (folder).
		<br>
		<b>chmod :</b> Change file mode.  You use this command to change what protections are applied to a file or directory.
		<br>
		<b>cp :</b> Copy a file.
		<br>
		<b>logout :</b> Terminate the connection to tux and return to the local command prompt on your computer.
		<br>
		<b>ls :</b> List the contents of a directory.
		<br>
		<b>man :</b> Print out the manual page about a command.
		<br>
		<b>mkdir :</b> Create a new directory.
		<br>
		<b>mv :</b> Move a file.
		<br>
		<b>nano :</b> Edit a file.
		<br>
		<b>rm :</b> Remove a file.
		<br>
		<b>uptime :</b> Print out how long the system has been up and how much load it currently has.
		<br><br>
		For a larger list of commands, check out
		<a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~kschmidt/Ref/unix_reference.html">Kurt's Unix for Newbies</a>
		<br><br>
		Now this is a lot to take in all at once.
		Don't try and memorize these commands.
		Learn them by using them.
		Test them out.
		Practice with them.
		<br><br>
		You used the uptime command in the last question, 
		and it is used by itself with no other information.
		Most of the other commands take one or two arguments that specify which files 
		or drectories they affect.  
		For example, if you want to learn more about the uptime command, you can issue the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>man uptime</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		and you'll be treated to a description of the command, 
		information about the various options,
		and how to interpret the output of the command.  
		The same is true of most commands on the system.
		Issuing the command man giving it the name of another command as an argument
		will result in documentation about that command.
		You can even get documentation about the man command by typing
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>man man</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		So for this question, we're gonna send you on a scavenger hunt.
		This will get you used to navigating a file system via command line.
		Helpful commands for this are ls, cat, and cd.
		At the end of your little scavenger hunt, you'll find a secret message.
		The secret message is your answer for the question.
		Enter the command below to start your quest.
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>cd ~src322/cs164maze</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		Now, start looking through the files in that directory using the commands from above.
	</p>	
	<br>
	<h3>Question 6 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		This and the next few questions will walk you through the process of 
		creating an initial web page.  
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 1:</b> The first thing to do is to make some configurations on Tux.
		Do this with the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>~bls96/cs164/bin/cs164setup</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		The command will not print anything out if you do it correctly.
		It is important to note, just because something is not printing out,
		does not mean something is incorrect.
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 2:</b> Issue the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>ls</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		to get a list of the current contents of your home directory.  
		This command will probably return without printing anything, 
		indicating that there are currently no files or directories in your home directory.  
		(It turns out this is not strictly true, but the difference is unimportant for now.)
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 3:</b> The convention for web servers on UNIX is that web pages for 
		individual users should all be in a directory called public_html.
		Assuming you have no such directory already, then create one with the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>mkdir public_html</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 4:</b> Next, we will set some characteristics of our new directory.
		Start by issuing the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>ls -l</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		This is the same command we used earlier to see that there were no files in 
		the home directory except that this time we've added the -l option.  
		This option tells ls to print out extra information about each file in the list.  
		You should get a line of output that looks something like:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>drwxrwxr-x 2 qqq42 qqq42  6 Sept 25 11:38 public_html/</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		Although you won't use all these details directly, 
		understanding what's happening under the covers is always a good thing.  
		The first character on the line is d which indicates that the item is a directory.  
		Following the d are the characters rwxrwxr-x.
		These 9 characters are divided into 3 sets of 3.
		Each set is composed of some combination of r, w, x, and -.
		An r indicates that the file can be read, a w that it can be written, 
		and an x that it can be executed or searched in the case of a directory.  
		Places where the - character appears indicate that the corresponding operation is not permitted.
		The three groups list the privileges for the owner, the group, and everyone else (called the world).
		The next item in the line is the number of links to the file, 
		which has to do with the internal design of the file system.
		The third item on the line is the name of the owner of the file, 
		and the fourth is the group that owns the file. 
		Following the ownership information is the size of the file, the last modification date of the file, and its name.
		<br><br>
		For an answer, enter the line you got as a result of the <code>ls -l</code> command.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 7 - Create a Website (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		You have created the environment in which your web pages will live. 
		The next step is to put some content into your web presence.
		To make the next several steps easier, we'll first move to the directory we just created with the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>cd public_html</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		The cd command effectively changes our current notion of what "here" means. 
		In this case, you've changed it to the new directory we created to hold your web content.
		We've made available a file for you to use as a starting point for your web content.
		To copy it to your public_html directory, issue the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>cp ~bls96/classes/cs164/template.html index.html</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		The result of this command is that you have copied a file called template.html 
		from the instructor's account into your public_html directory with the name index.html.
		By convention, index.html is the name of the file that web servers provide 
		when a URL is requsted that contains no file name.
		<br><br>
		Now that you've put some content on your web site, let's take a look at it.  
		Open a web browser on your computer and go to the URL:
		<br><br>
		<tab5>http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~<i>userid</i>/</tab5>
		<br><br>
		where you'll replace userid with your username on tux.
		The resulting page should look something like this:
	</p>
	<center>
		<img src="labs/template.jpg">
	</center>
	<p>
		Depending on whether you got all the details correct and some configuration defaults, 
		it's possible you might get an error here instead of the desired page.  
		Errors such as "File not found," "Forbidden," or "Permission Denied" indicate that something is not quite right.
		This is a good example of how finding and fixing problem generally involves thinking at a lower level of abstraction.
		To find and fix any problems you need to make sure you have a clear sense of
		how the files are organized on tux and of how permissions are assigned. 
		Once you figure out what's wrong, 
		commands like chmod and mv will be useful for correcting things.  
		The key things that need to be true here are:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Your index.html file must be in your public_html directory</li>
		<li>Your public_html directory must be world readable and executable (e.g. permissions of rwxrwxr-x)</li>
		<li>Your index.html file must be world readable (e.g. permissions of rw-rw-r--)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		As an answer, describe any problems you had getting the correct page to appear.
		If there were no problems, simply state "No problems".
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 8 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Obviously, this isn't the actual web page we want to serve. 
		So it's time to edit it to make the information on it relevant to us.
		Go back to your terminal window where you're logged into tux and issue the command:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>nano index.html</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		You'll be presented with a screen that looks something like:
	</p>
	<center>
		<img src="labs/pico.jpg">
	</center>
	<p>
		This is a text editor called nano.
		Like most text editing environments you've probably experienced, 
		you can move around in the text with the arrow keys 
		(though arrow keys are one of the things that has been problematic with the Windows port of OpenSSH in the past).
		The cursor can also be moved with the control characters: 
		^P for the previous line, 
		^N for the next line, 
		^F to move forward one character and 
		^B to move back one character.  
		Plain text that you type is inserted at the point in the text where the cursor is.
		<br><br>
		For those who are familiar with (or want to learn) other editors like emacs and vi, 
		they are also available on tux.  
		In fact, you will be strongly encouraged to learn and to use such 
		editors when you use tux in later courses, such as CS265.
		If you want to learn about emacs or vim, talk to your TA.
		<br><br>
		What may be different from your previous experience is that 
		there are no drop-down menus for other operations.
		As indicated by the bottom two lines of the screen, 
		there are a number of operations that can be triggered by control characters.  
		These characters are typed by holding down the control key (often labeled Ctrl) 
		and while holding it, typing the corresponding letter.  
		For example, as indicated by the left-most prompt on the next to last line of the screen,
		typing control-G will result in a help screen being printed.
		<br><br>
		Another aspect of this editor that sometimes throws students off is that it is not mouse-based.  
		You can't position the cursor or select text with the mouse.  
		You'll want to use the various control characters or arrow keys to move the the cursor.
		Similarly, don't assume that the scroll bar in your terminal window has any effect on the editor.
		If you've scrolled things so that the help information is missing from the bottom two lines,
		then what you see isn't what the editor is seeing.
		<br><br>
		The thing to keep in mind with both of these points is that the editor is running on tux, 
		not on your computer.
		What's running on your computer is a terminal emulator.
		Things you tell the terminal emulator to do aren't seen by the editor on tux.
		So when you want to save the file or scroll, you need to tell the editor to do so, 
		and that's done with the control character commands listed at 
		the bottom of the screen and documented in the help screens.
		<br><br>
		Spend some time getting comfortable with nano.
		Make sure all members of your group are able to start nano, make changes, and save those changes.
		For an answer, describe how you would go about searching for a string of text that you might want to change.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 9 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Step 1:</b> Now you will need to modify this file, 
		according to the lines that contain the "DELETE" phrases. 
		The first two are simple - delete the lines and replace them with your name and today's date. 
		These lines are comments, meaning they are encoded in the file, 
		but do not appear on the web page when viewed by a browser.
		<br><br>
		The second should say "DELETE AND ENTER LAB#". 
		Replace this text with "Lab 1". 
		The next two statements require you to enter your name (again) and Section #. 
		Do this.
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 2:</b> The last place requires you to enter the URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
		for the CS 164 instructor web site.
		Enter this text between the quote symbols:
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bls96/</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 3:</b> Save the file, and test it with your browser. 
		Answer these questions:
		<ol>
			<li>Does the text "Lab 1" appear in the title bar of the browser window?</li>
			<li>Does the document part contain your name in large bold print, 
				your section number on the next line, 
				and a link to the CS 164 web site on the third?</li>
			<li>When you click on the underlined text, 
			does your browser open up the CS 164 instructor page?</li>
		</ol>
		If you answered "no" to any of these questions, 
		you need to make corrections in your file. 
		Do this until the answer to each question is "yes".
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 10 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		The last step is to copy the new HTML file you've created to your computer.
		Start that process by logging out of tux.
		You should log out of it each time you're finished using it.
		Either the exit or logout command can be used for this. 
		When you issue that command, you'll be returned to the local command prompt on your computer.
		At your local computer's prompt (not the tux prompt), 
		use the scp command from the ssh package to copy the file from tux to your computer.
		<br><br>
		<tab5><code>scp </code><i>userid</i><code>@tux.cs.drexel.edu:public_html/index.html .</code></tab5>
		<br><br>
		If you are running Windows and have not been able to install and run OpenSSH, 
		then use the file transfer capability of the software that you did install.
		<br><br>
		As before, use your userid rather than the literal string userid.
		You'll have to enter your password again to complete the copy.
		The scp program uses the same authentication mechanisms and 
		encryption protocols as ssh does for copying files between two computers.
		<br><br>
		Not only does this give you a local copy of the file, 
		it is the first step if you wish you use a different mode of operation.
		In particular, instead of logging into tux to to edit your files,
		it's possible to edit your files on your local computer and then copy them to tux.
		The benefit to doing so is that you can use whatever editor
		you're comfortable with on your local computer.
		The downside is that you'll have to be conscious of which version of which file
		is on which computer and you'll have to be careful about actions
		that can cause protection modes to be changed.
		Now that you're familiar with how to connect to a remote machine
		and manipulate the files there, 
		you are welcome to work in whichever mode you feel more comfortable.
		<br><br>
		If you would like more information on scp and ssh, there is a link on BBLearn under "Course Information"
		<br><br>
		For your answer, give the full path for the location of the file on your local system.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 11 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Before we move on to complete this lab, 
		you may be wondering why we're using command-line tools.
		After all, they're soooo 20th century.
		The reality is that experienced professionals should be comfortable with 
		a wide variety of tools and choose the tools appropriate to each situation.
		There's an old saying that when the only tool in your toolbox is a hammer,
		all the world looks like a nail.
		<br><br>
		Now that you've gotten some familiarity with using command-line tools,
		you are free to explore options that have a point-and-click flavor to them.
		We start with some tools that are available to you at
		<a href="http://software.drexel.edu">http://software.drexel.edu</a>.
		For Mac users,
		there's a package called Fetch that you can download and install to connect and transfer files via ssh.
		Those using Windows, can download and install a package called SSHSecureS.
		Outside of the packages available on Drexel's software distribution, 
		there's a package called 
		<a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a> 
		that is ported to a wide variety of platforms, including Linux, Mac, and Windows.
		One of the most commonly used packages on Windows is called 
		<a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>.
		Finally, if you want to use your phone or tablet, there are SSH implementations for both Android and iOS.
		<br><br>
		The bottom line is that I want you to come away from this lab being equally
		knowledgable and equally comfortable with both a command-line way 
		of doing things and a GUI way of doing things.
		Only then will you be in a position to make a reasoned judgement as to 
		which approach will be most effective in any given situation.
		Doing things in a particular way because it's the only way you know how 
		to do it isn't making a thoughtful and reasoned decision.
		Instead, it's more a willful refusal to learn something new.
		<br><br>
		Does all the world look like a nail to you?
		Why or why not? 
		Record your answer.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 12 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Include a link to your website here so the TAs can properly grade it.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 13 - Slack (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		In an attempt to make it easier for y'all to keep in contact with your TAs and classmates to ask questions, we created a Slack channel.
		TAs are identifiable with the (TA) abbreviation. Join using the link below.
		<br><br>
		<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cs164-fa20/signup">Slack Channel Join Link</a>
		<br><br>
		Once in the channel, set your name to whatever your name is on Blackboard.
		If you have a preferred name set, that is what it is on Blackboard.
		If you need help setting a preferred name, talk to your TA.
		Put your pronouns alongside your name.
		If you wanna make it super easy for us to identify you, upload a profile picture of yourself.
		<br>
		<br>
		To recieve credit for this question, post a quick bio in the #introductions channel.
		It would also be nice if you sent a message to a TA to say hi.
		We're nice people who want to help you in this course so it would be smart to get used to messaging us.
		The message can be anything!
		Say hello!
		Ask a question!
		Send us a meme!
		Start a conversation!
		Grading tends to get boring so have fun with it.
