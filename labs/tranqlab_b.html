<h1>Lab 6 - Introduction to Tranquility - NO EXPERIENCE</h1>
<p>
As usual, answer all questions in a <i>plain text file</i>
named <code>questions6.txt</code>.
At the top of your plain text file, include your name, student ID, and lab section.
Failure to do so will result in a 0.

<p>
This lab is meant for people with little to no programming experience.
If you are an advanced programmer, we suggest doing the other lab
instead. 
</p>
<p>
We're going to walk through the CARDIAC lab you did last week, 
this time in Tranquility. We will take in many positive numbers until we get
a negative number. Then print out the running sum and count and average of
the positive numbers.
More we'll walk through planning a program and compiling and testing.
</p>

<h3>Question 1 - Tutorial (5 pts)</h3>
<p>
First, do this quick
<a href="http://cs.drexel.edu/~src322/cs164/labs/tranqtut/tranq.html">tutorial</a>
on Tranquility and programming to prepare yourself for the lab. If
you're confused about any questions, ask a TA.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 2(15 pts)</h3>
<p>
Let's think about what we did to start last week. We answered these questions
while keeping the CARDIAC in mind
</p>
<ul>
<li> Pick a name for a memory location where the data will be read </li>
<li> Which instruction is used to read an input card into memory? </li>
<li> How will you get the number you just read into the accumulator to test it?</li>
<li> What action will you take if the number is positive and what action if it's negative? </li>
</ul>
<p>
Now these questions are a great starting point for calculating the average of
a group of numbers. However, Tranquility doesn't have a input deck or
accumulator. So these questions aren't very helpful anymore.
<br><br>
First, rephrase these questions in a more helpful way. Rewrite them to fit
Tranquility better. There's no correct answer here, whatever questions get
you in the Tranquility mindset and cover the same material.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Question 3 (10 pts)</h3>
<p>
Answer the questions you rewrote for the previous questions. Still, only think
in terms of English (or whatever language helps you think better but please
write your answer in English so I can grade these). Do not write Tranquility
code yet.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Question 4 (15 pts)</h3>
<p>
Now, think about sequentially the actions we will take when doing this program.
Write a few sentences about how you want your program to flow and run. Think 
about using the words *loop/repeat* and *if* and *else/otherwise*.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 5 (5 pts)</h3>
<p>
We've thought long and hard about writing the program, and have planned it out
very well. Let's actually write code, but where do we even start?
<br><br>
Look at the examples in the Tranquility manual. The first example is Hello
World. What line of code does this example have in common with the example on
Page 3 or the example on Page 7? What does this line of code mean?
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 6 (5 pts)</h3>
<p>
Let's write some code! We're going to use nano to create this file and we're
going to name it <tt>lab6.t</tt>
<br><br>
Inside of the <tt>init</tt> function, translate your algorithm from Question 4
into real Tranquility code. Pages 12 and 13 have lists of functions that will
help you. What functions are used to get user input? Which one is more
beneficial to us in this program and why?
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 7 (5 pts)</h3>
<p>
Now let's run and test our code we wrote. Don't be worried if it doesn't work
right away. Also, don't be afraid to run code that might not work! Debugging
and testing is a big part of programming.
<br><br>
First, let's compile this code into machine code that the virtual machine can
interpret. Page 1 covers how to compile Tranquility code. What command did you
use to compile your code? Use the <tt>-a</tt> flag to aid in our programming
experience (this will come into play later)
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 8 (10 pts)</h3>
<p>
The compiler either provided output or it didn't. If you got no output, it
means everything compiled correctly. If you get output, it means you had
errors. Did you get errors? What errors did you get? How did you fix them in
your code?
<br><br>
Repeat this process until you have no errors. Tell us how your debugging
process went.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 9 (10 pts)</h3>
<p>
Once you run out of compile time errors, it's time to test your code to make
sure you got the desired output and functionality. The -a flag in the tranqc
command earlier created a lab6.html file in your public_html directory. Go
to this webpage in your browser and test your code.
<br><br>
Did your code produce the desired output? If not, how will you change your code
to make it work? After changing your code, make sure to recompile, debug, then
test again until you have a working product.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 10 (10 pts)</h3>
<p>
Finally, we are going to perform the final step of the CARDIAC program that we
didn't implement in the CARDIAC, we are going to divide the running sum but the
count of numbers and produce an average.
<br><br>
Implement that step, debug, and test your code. Does it work? If it doesn't
repeat until it does. Describe how this process went for you.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Question 11 (10 pts)</h3>
<p>
Post the link to your website with the working code here. The code is worth
10 points while the other 10 questions are worth 90.
