<h1>CARDIAC Arrest</h1>
<p>	
	In class, we discussed the CARDIAC and a small example of adding two numbers.
	In this lab, you will develop a more capable summation program.  
	Your program will read in a variable number of values and print out the number of values read and their sum
</p>
<p>
	Make sure to answer the following lab questions in a plain text file named questions5.txt
	At the top of your plain text file, include your name, user id, and lab section.

<h3>Question 1 (10pts)</h3>
<p>
	The plan is to keep reading numbers from the input until a negative number is read.  
	Which instruction allows us to test a number and decide on a different course of action if that number is negative?

	<h3>Question 2 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		For the next step you should write the instructions that will repeatedly read an input until a negative number is read.  
		To do this, there are several details to address:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Pick a name for a memory location where the data will be read.</li>
		<li>Which instruction is used to read an input card into memory?</li>
		<li>How will you get the number you just read into the accumulator to test it?</li>
		<li>What action will you take if the number is positive and what action if it's negative?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The first step is to answer these questions in english.
		Explain the process of what's happening in english words.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Question 3 (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
		The last question you answer in english words.
		Now, turn those english words into assembly code.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Question 4 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Convert the assembly language from your answer to the previous question to machine language in the same way as shown in the examples.
		In doing so, remember you'll need to select memory locations for your variables and code.  
		I suggest putting the variable into which you read numbers at memory location 04 and that you put your code starting at location 10.
		Enter the addresses and values as an answer.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 5 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Now it's time to test out your program on the CARDIAC simulator.
		Enter the program numbers you answered in the previous question into the CARDIAC's memory.  
		Put the values into 005, 010, and -001 into the input deck. 
		Now press, Load and Reset.  
		Then click Step repeatedly until your program halts.  
		Did it correctly read in each number and stop when it read the negative number? 
		Were there any problems that your testing exposed?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 6 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		The next step is to enhance your program so that it counts the number of non-negative values read.
		Each time you've read a non-negative number, add one to the count.  
		When a negative number is read, use the OUT instruction to output the count.
		Put your modified assembly language program in the answer box below.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 7 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		As before, convert your assembly language program into machine language.  
		Put the addresses and values as the answer.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 8 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Put this modified program into the CARDIAC as you did the previous one.
		You may want to click the "Clear Mem" button to clear out the memory before starting.
		Test your program with the same input cards as before.
		Does it correctly output the number 002?  
		Did you have to fix any bugs with this one?
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 9 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		The final development step is to add the input values to a running sum.  
		You'll be able to draw on the example from class for this part. 
		When you read a negative number, output the sum after the count.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 10 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		As with the other two parts, assemble the program and put the addresses and values as the answer.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Question 11 (10pts)</h3>
	<p>
		Test your new program with the same input card deck.  
		Do you get the right answers?  
		Test your program with other sets of data.  
		Put the input values that you use for testing along with the results generated by your program.  
		Share test data with your group members.  
		So you should be able to report the same number of tests as you have team members.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Extra Credit (5pts)</h3>
	<p>
<!--
		If you're in the Honors section, 65H this is not extra credit.
		This is normal credit.
		Failure to answer will result in the loss of 5 points.
		Everyone else, this is extra credit for you.
		<br><br>
-->
		For extra credit, generate and test a bootable card deck for your program.  
		Put your debugged card deck as an answer.
