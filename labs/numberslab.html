<h3 id="question-1-5pts">Question 1 (5pts)</h3>
<p>In class, we discussed hexadecimal as a convenient representation of numbers. One place where that gets used frequently is specifying colors on web pages. For the next several questions, you are encouraged to use the web to find any answers you don't already know.<br />
<br />
How many hexadecimal digits are used to specify a color in a web page? How many bits do these hexadecimal digits correspond to?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-2-10pts">Question 2 (10pts)</h3>
<p>What are the primary colors specified by these hexadecimal values? How many bits are assigned to each color? What is the range of values for each of the primary colors used on web pages?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-3-10pts">Question 3 (10pts)</h3>
<p>There are about 16 million possible colors that can be specified in this way. A relatively small subset have been given standard names. What are the hexadecimal values for the following colors: Heliotrope Purple, Dimorphotheca Magenta, and Rubber Ducky Yellow? For each of those hexadecimal values, what are the corresponding RGB values?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-4-5pts">Question 4 (5pts)</h3>
<p>In HTML, we can include any Unicode characters. All special characters in HTML are specified in the form:<br />
<br />
</p>
<pre><code>&amp;spec;\</code></pre>
<p><br />
These special characters all start with the ampersand and end with a semicolon. How would you specify the symbols ¬ , ∨ , and ∧ in HTML?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-5-15pts">Question 5 (15pts)</h3>
<p>You've had some fun playing with the applications of hexadecimal. Now, let's take a deeper look at the fundamentals of hex. Make a table with 16 rows and 4 columns. The columns should be Base 10, Base 2, Base 4, and Base 16. The rows should be the numerical values for 0 through 15<sub>10</sub> in each base. Each number in each column should have the same number of digits, so pad as necessary.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-6-5pts">Question 6 (5pts)</h3>
<p>So if you did the table properly and padded properly, you might start to notice some patterns. What patterns did you find?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-7-10pts">Question 7 (10pts)</h3>
<p>If you found the patterns, this question will be super easy. Convert this binary number to hexadecimal. Then, convert it to base-4.</p>
<p><code>011010011101101011011011111011101111010000100000</code></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-8-10pts">Question 8 (10pts)</h3>
<p>In the past few labs, we've been introducing HTML. We're gonna take the table you just wrote for Question 5, and make it in HTML. In an HTML file called <code>numbers.html</code> recreate the table from Question 5.<br />
<br />
A table begins with the string:<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;table&gt;</code><br />
<br />
and ends with the string:<br />
<br />
<code>&lt;/table&gt;</code><br />
<br />
This is typical of many parts of HTML. In HTML, things enclosed in angle brackets are called tags. Many tags come in pairs where the first opens a structure and the structue is closed by the same tag with a slash prepended. Here, the table is specified between the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag and the <code>&lt;/table&gt;</code> tag.<br />
<br />
Tables are composed of rows, each of which has a number elements. What are the tags used to start and end a row of a table? What are the tags used to begin and end a table data element?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3 id="question-9-30pts">Question 9 (30pts)</h3>
<p>Let's talk more about colors. In particular, we're going to manipulate the binary numbers that describe the colors. The numbers are generally taken to be unsigned, but just for fun, we're going to treat them as signed numbers. Then after negating them, we'll treat the resulting bit patterns as unsigned numbers and display the resulting colors.<br />
<br />
What we've been doing is looking at them as hexadecimal values like #FFFFFF or as base-10 RGB values. Let's look more into the binary. The reason we have 256 shades of colors is because that fits very nicely with a power of 2. This means, it's much easier to represent colors in binary. Let's look at plain red. Plain red has a hex value of #FF0000 and an RGB value of (255, 0, 0). Red, as a binary RGB value is (11111111, 00000000, 00000000). As we learned in class, there is a variety of ways to represent binary numbers. Right now, we are using an unsigned approach. What if we took a signed approach?<br />
<br />
Let's take all our values and negate them using sign magnitude. 11111111 would become 01111111 which is now 127. 00000000 would become 10000000 which is now -0, or just normal 0. However, RGB values only take unsigned numbers. If we interpret our signed 10000000 and interpret it as unsigned, it's 128. Our new RGB value for negative red is now (127, 128, 128).<br />
<br />
Let's do the same thing with one's complement! 11111111 would become 00000000 which is 0. 00000000 would become 11111111 which is -0. Since RGB doesn't take negative values, we'll just interpret this as unsigned and use 255. So now the RGB value for one's complement negative red is (0, 255, 255).<br />
<br />
Finally, let's do this all again with two's complement. 11111111 will become 00000001 which is 1. 00000000 will become 00000000 which is 0. Negative red in two's complement is now (1,0,0). I made a table below of the colors.</p>

<p>For the grand finale of this lab, complete this table with blue (#0000FF), green (#00FF00), rubber ducky yellow, heliotrope purple, dimorphotheca magenta, and at least two more colors of your own choosing. You can put this table in your numbers.html file. Include a link to this on your index.html</p>
<p><em>PSSST! To specify the background color of a table data element, you can use the bgcolor property.</em></p>
