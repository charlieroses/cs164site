	    	<hr>
	    	<p>
				Since binary only uses 0's and 1's, there are no + and - signs to define a positive and a negative number.
				There are multiple different ways to express a negative binary number.
   			</p>
   			<hr>
   			<h2>Sign Magnitude</h2>
   			<p>
				<b>Most Significant Bit (MSB):</b> The leftmost bit in a number. Eg: <b>1</b>0011001
   			</p>
   			<p>
				The MSB is the most significant bit when representing a sign magnitude negative number. 
				If the MSB is a 0, the number is positive. 
				If the MSB is 1, the number is negative. 
				From there, the following bits are calculated the same way that any binary number is calulated
   			</p>
   			<center>
   				<table>
					<tr>
	   					<th class="smt"><b>Byte</b></th>
					    <th class="smt"><b>Sign</b></th>
					    <th class="smt"><b>Value</b></th>

					    <td class="smt">10001111</th>

					    <td class="smt">-15</th>

					    <td class="smt">Positive</th>
					    <td class="smt">+52</th>

					    <td class="smt">10011101</th>
					    <td class="smt">Negative</th>
					    <td class="smt">-29</th>

   			<p>
				A minor setback to the sign magnitude method is that we have now limited the range of the 8 bit value.
				Since the MSB is now taken to show sign, only 7 bits remain for magnitude.
				Normally an 8 bit value would have the range of 0 to 255.
				The range of a signed 8 bit number is now -127 to 127.
				Now, when we're just defining numbers, this does not cause any problems.
				However, when we get to adding and subtracting values, this will cause an overflow error.
				We'll cross thats bridge when we get to it.
  	 		</p>
  	 		<hr>

  	 		<h2>One's Complement</h2>
   			<p>
				One's complement is the least used negative representation system.
				When doing one's complement, the positive value is exactly the same as sign magnitude.
				For example 00001010<sub>2</sub> is still +10<sub>10</sub>.
				The difference is when representing negative numbers.
				When representing negative numbers, you invert all the bits.
				The 1's become 0's and the 0's become 1's.
				Below is the process for making 10<sub>10</sub> negative.
   			</p>
   			<p>
   				<code>
					<tab5>Convert Bases: 10<sub>10</sub> = 00001010<sub>2</sub></tab5>
					<br>
					<tab5>Invert Bits: 00001010 > 11110101</tab5>
					<br>
					<tab5>-10<sub>10</sub> = 11110101<sub>2</sub></tab5>
   				</code>
   			</p>
   			<p>
				Just as sign magnitude had overflow errors with range, so does one's complement.
				In fact, one's complement has the same exact range issue.
				Remember, normally an 8 bit value would have the range of 0 to 255.
				Now, the range of a signed 8 bit number is -127 to 127.
				One's complement also presents other errors when doing addition and subtraction.
				We tend not to use One's Complement as much.
   			</p>
   			<hr>

   			<h2>Two's Complement</h2>
   			<p>
				Two's complement is much more widely used than one's complement.
				It makes addition and subtraction much easier.
				We'll get to addition and subtraction and more fun values soon.
				Right now, let's focus on defining numbers.
				Just as the other methods, the positive number stays the same.
				00001010<sub>2</sub> is still +10<sub>10</sub>.
				The process for negating the number starts the same as one's complement.
				We first invert the bits.
				Then we add one.
				The process is shown below.
		    </p>
		    <p>
   				<code>
					<tab5>Convert Bases: 53<sub>10</sub> = 00110101<sub>2</sub></tab5>
					<br>
					<tab5>Invert Bits: 00110101 > 11001010</tab5>
					<br>
					<tab5>Add One: 11001010 + 1 > 11001011</tab5>
					<br>
					<tab5>10<sub>10</sub> = 11110101<sub>2</sub></tab5>
   				</code>
   			</p>
   			<p>
				Once again we come across the same range issue.
				An unsigned 8 bit number has a range of 0 to 255.
				A signed two's complement number has a range of -127 to 127.
				Unlike one's complement and sign magnitude, two's complement does not have addition and subtraction problems.
				This makes two's complement the most desirable form for operating on.
   			</p>
