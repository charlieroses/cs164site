      <h1>6.4 : Tranquility</h1>
      <hr>
	  <p>
		We get a lot of questions about Tranquility in this class. 
		I'm going to use this section to share our vision and frustrations
		with those of you who care to read.
		Tranquility is a custom language that Dr. Stuart wrote in the summer
		of '69 (it was actually 2019).
		I had a bit of input on it, but he wrote the compiler.
		Our goal is to create a language with no practical industry value.
		We've noticed that students come to college only willing to learn what
		will help them get a job. 
		They want to learn as many languages as they can fit on their resume
		to make themselves "marketable".
		That being said, students are losing valuable skills and knowledge that
		is needed for actually being a valuable employee.
		There's a certain amount of understanding you need to be a good 
		programmer.
		Anyone can copy and paste Java code from StackOverflow into an IDE and
		make it run. 
		It takes a special, more valuable programmer to understand what the code
		is doing and how it relates to other concepts to write their own code
		and read documentation and comprehend it.
		I am not a master of any single language.
		Have I ever programmed in C++ or C#?
		No.
		Do I know enough about how programming languages work to learn these 
		languages quickly if needed?
		Yes.
		It's the understanding that is being lost.
		You'll learn proper resume building programming next term in CS-171.
		In this class, there's a much higher focus on just understanding how
		code interacts with machines.
		This is why we have Tranquility. 
		We want to teach minimal coding with maximum understanding.
		If you truly take the time to learn the material, you won't have something
		to put on your resume, but you will have the skills you need to succeed
		in higher level courses.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		How do you learn Tranquility?
		You only get the PDF manual.
		That's all you need.
		That's all you get.
		No Googling.
		No StackOverflow.
		Reading documentation is an amazing skill that will benefit you
		extremely in life.
