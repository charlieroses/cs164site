		You've successfully navigated to my site.
		I call this site many things, a textbook, a study guide, the course website.
		It's goal is to present the material is a comprehensive written way.
		The lecture slides are purposefully left bare to promote paying attention in
		lecture. However, it's very easy to get lost in the information as lecture covers
		many topics varying in complexity. In an effort to better explain the material,
		this site was created.
		Also, yes, I am aware the CSS for this site is not great.
		Please accept it and move on.
		I used to have much more motivation to make the CSS nicer. 
		Now I'm just tryna make this all work.

	  <h2>The Organization</h2>
	  <p>
		The most accurate of the above terms that I like to use is textbook due to its
		structure. I've organized this "textbook" into "chapters". The chapters do not
		exactly follow the order of lectures. I chose the grouping based on related 
		material and how I felt would be the most logical order of content.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		As I continue teaching this course, I learn new ways to present the material. 
		I also use a variety of ways to present material on pages. That includes text,
		images, embedded circuits, and practice problems. If you have issues accessing
		any of this, please let me know. I will do my best to fix it. I also understand
		that everyone has different styles of learning, so I did my best to cover many
		different ways of explaining.
