			<h3>Some History</h3>
			<p>
				So in order to understand the basis of how operating systems are built
				and the techniques and designs behind them, it's important to know where
				computers started.
				Thinking back to early computers, they were typically built for one
				purpose.
				These computers really didn't need operating systems.
				These computers didn't need a way to manage games and browers and 
				multitasking the way modern operating systems do.
				After this age of computers that performed computations for us, we 
				moved into an era of computers that were programmable via punch cards.
				Programmers would draw out their code, punch the cards, then bring the
				cards to a central computer.
				This computer still had limited functionality.
				It was intended to only have one user at a time running one program
				at a time.
				In a university with only one computer and more than one user, you can
				see some issues would form.
				Well let's say a bunch of students and researchers all need to run their
				programs.
				I propose a complete free for all.
				Throw everyone in a boxing ring and whoever survives gets to run their
				program.
				According to universities this is "dangerous" and "a complete waste of
				time", but I digress.
				Since we can't have a brawl to the death to use the computer, we need a
				sense of organization. 
				Instead of having multiple gross greasey users touching our expensive
				computer, let's have a designated <i>Computer Person</i> who is solely
				in charge of taking your punchcards and putting them in the computer.
				Well now we have an ultimate sword fight to decide who gives their 
				program to the <i>Computer User</i> first?
				No?
				Okay.
				Well, if we can't have valiant sword fights, I guess a sign up sheet 
				will have to do.
				The <i>Designated Computer Person</i> will post the sign up sheet. 
				The programmers sign up for a time slot to run their programs, then
				drop them off and give them to our <i>Almighty Computer Person</i>.
				The <i>Lord of the Computer</i> then takes your program at your time
				slot, runs it as scheduled, then takes your output and puts it in your
				mailbox.
				So now, this computer that can only run one thing at a time, now has
				a good <i>S Y S T E M</i> to <i>O P E R A T E</i> on so we can run more
				than one program.

			<h3>Modern Operating Systems</h3>
	    	<p>
				So how does a large singular computer impact our modern operating
				systems?
				Let's first take a moment to define what an operating system is and
				what is required of it.
				When most of y'all think of operating systems, you think about Microsoft
				and MACOS and all these horrible commercial products.
				While these are operating systems, they provide a lot more functionality
				than what we're going to cover.
				At its core, an operating system acts as the bridge between the hardware 
				of the machine, and the software.
				It is in charge of managing the hardware resources among all the different
				entities being run.
				It provides common services and interfaces to applications that run on it.
