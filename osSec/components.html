			So the operating system has a few different roles and purposes. 
			This section covers those different roles and what they mean.

			<h3>Resource Manager</h3>
			<p>
				If you actually read my little "History" section in the 
				<a href="osSec/intro.html">OSverview</a>, you'll recall I mentioned
				a desginated <i>Almighty Computer Person</i> who was in charge of
				designating time for programs to run on the computer. For the most
				part, this is very similar to the function of a <b>resource manager</b>.
				Operating systems work as resource managers in managing the physical
				resources and the memory that each program uses. This makes sure 
				everything stays where it needs to stay and protects the system from
				attacks.

				What does this mean in a more practical sense? Well, let's say we have
				program A and program B. Resource managers means that these programs 
				are going to operate in separate chunks of memory. Let's say program A
				is an <i>evil program</i>. This program A is going to edit the memory
				that program B is running on. Program B will either crash now, or it
				will produce incorrect results. Resource managers prevent this from
				happening.
			</p>

			<h3>Service Provider</h3>
	    	<p>
				Operating systems also function as a service provider.
				Since operating systems act as a bridge between hardware and the 
				software that runs on it, you could consider it as a piece of 
				software that provides the services of the hardware to the software
				and applcations we run on top of it.
				This provides a common interface for applications to run on top of.
	    	</p>

			<hr>
			<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
			<p>
				Above, we mention that the operating system acts as a service provider,
				and one of the services it provides is a common interface for the
				applications to run on top of. 
				Looking at the operating system from the perspective of an application,
				it draws no distinction between the operating system and the hardware,
				since it has to use the OS to use the hardware.
				This allows for flexibility in hardware design.
