	    	<h1>7.3 : Responsibilities</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Now we know the roles the operating system plays, but what is it
				responsible for getting done. There are plenty of responsibilities
				that I don't cover in this section, but I wanted to give a general
				understanding of the range of things operating systems deal with,
				since Windows and MACOS do a lot of extra things.
			</p>

			<h3>Hardware</h3>
			<p>
				So this section is honestly just easier to list out.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>CPU</li>
				<li>Input and Output Devices</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Provides common devise interface tasks</li>
					<li>Hides device details</li>
					<li>Establish access to a device</li>
					<li>Manages exclusive access</li>
					<li>Release a device</li>
					<li>Read form a device</li>
					<li>Write to a device</li>
					<li>Grant access to a device</li>
					<li>Provide special device operations</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Memory</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Assigns areas of memory belonging to processes to
					areas of physical space<li>
					<li>Manages requests that are greater than available memory</li>
					<li>Controls sharing of memory</li>
					<li>Direct allocation requests</li>
					<li>Direct freeing of memory</li>
					<li>Serving memory needs implicit in other services</li>
					<li>Managing sharing of areas of memory</li>
					<li>This is a large part of "resource management"</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3>File Systems</h3>
	    	<p>
				We're not going to go incredibly in depth as to how file systems
				work in this course. You've been interacting with file systems your
				whole computer life though. You've been interacting a little more in
				depth in this course on Tux with the command line. One of the great
				things your operating system does is it manages a lot of this file
				stuff. It manages the names of files and the storage of them. It also
				covers the basic file services, which I'll list below.
	    	</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Opening files</li>
				<li>Closing files</li>
				<li>Reading files</li>
				<li>Writing to files</li>
				<li>Seeking in a file</li>
				<li>Querying and modifying file parameters</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>Processes</h3>
			<p>
				Before we start, a process can be simply known as the execution of code.
				While, in a single program, only one line of code will execute at a time,
				we can run multiple programs at the same time. In one program, it is
				very simple to make sure that memory locations aren't been written over
				each other, and the programmer can handle that for the most part. 
				However, when we run multiple programs at the same time, we run into
				the issue of resource management. This was also touched upon in the
				previous section about how the operating system acts as a resource 
				manager. With these processes, the OS deals with the management of memory
				and resources, like mentioned above. The OS also deals with the execution
				of these programs. In a "breaking the fourth wall" moment, the OS also
				deals with the execution of the programs that makes the OS. I've listed
				below a few different things that the OS also deals with in terms of
				processes.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating processes</li>
				<li>Destroying processes</li>
				<li>Changing priorities of processes</li>
				<li>Providing interprocess communication</li>
				<li>Process synchronization</li>
			</ul>
	
			<hr>
			<h3>Security</h3>
			<p>
				If you read above, you'll see we already touch upon aspects of security.
				The operating system frequently manages permissions between users and what
				they can access. It also manages processes and making sure they don't write
				over each other. There's also the more common aspect of security that is
				what normally comes to mind in the digital age. When an OS recieves a 
				network request, the OS deals with the authentication of that and the 
				security policies surrounding those requests.
			</p>
